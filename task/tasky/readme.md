DESCRIPTION
===========

> This is a desktop client for Google Tasks that runs in the command line. It
provides a fast way to interface with all task lists of a user and make
changes and updates very quickly. This program has been designed to make as
few API calls as possible in order to optimize performance.

DEPENDENCIES
===========

> Requires Python 2.7, the GNU Readline library (`sudo easy_install readline`),
and the [Google API client for Python](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/).

USAGE
=====

> Quick Mode
> ----------

> > ### Common Operations ###

> > + Adding a task (`a`):

> >     `$` **`python tasky.py a --title "Title of task" --date "5/14/11" --note "This is a note."
> >     --parent "Parent task name"`**

> >     OR

> >     `$` **`python tasky.py a -t "Title of task" -d "5/14/11" -n"This is a note." - "Parent task name"`**

> >     All of the above fields are optional except for the title and can appear
> >     in any order.

> > + Removing a task and its children (`r`):

> >     `$` **`python tasky.py r --title "Title of task"`**

> >     OR

> >     `$` **`python tasky.py r -t "Title of task"`**

> > + Toggling a task and its children (`t`):

> >     `$` **`python tasky.py t --title "Title of task"`**

> >     OR

> >     `$` **`python tasky.py t -t "Title of task"`**

> > + Listing all tasks (`l`):

> >     `$` **`python tasky.py l`**

> > **Note:** The task list can be printed after the execution of the operation by
adding a (`--list`) or (`-l`) flag to the command.

> Normal Mode
> -----------

> > `$` **`python tasky.py`**

> > ### Tab Completion ###

> > Then follow the on-screen instruction. Tab-completion is supported, so you can
type the beginning of an existing task name. For example:

> >     Name of task: Lea<TAB>

> > If there is more than one match, all matches will be listed on the second tab:

> >     Name of task: Lea<TAB><TAB>
> >     Learn Java  Learn C++

> > Otherwise, the task name will be filled in.

> > ### Partial String Searching ###

> > In addition, Tasky also support partial string searching, so you
can type just any consecutive portion of any task name when searching for it.
All of the matched results will be displayed and you can specify the number
for the result you desire.

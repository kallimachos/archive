# Challenge Description:
#
# Assume that someone dictates you a sequence of numbers, and you need to write
# it down. For brevity, he dictates it as follows: first he dictates the number
# of consecutive identical numbers, and then - the number itself.
#
# For example:
# The sequence below
#
# 1 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 14 14 14 11 11 11 2
#
# is dictated as follows:
#
# two times one, three times three, four times two, three times fourteen, three
# times eleven, one time two
#
# and you have to write down the sequence
#
# 2 1 3 3 4 2 3 14 3 11 1 2
#
# Your task is to write a program that compresses a given sequence using this
# approach.
# Input sample:
#
# 40 40 40 40 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 57 57 92 92 92 92 92 86 86 86 86 86 86 86
# 86 86 86
# 73 73 73 73 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
# 1 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 14 14 14 11 11 11 2
# 7
#
# Your program should accept a path to a file as its first argument that
# contains T number of lines. Each line is a test case represented by a
# sequence of integers with the length L, where each integer is N separated by
# a space.
# Output sample:
#
# 4 40 8 29 2 57 5 92 10 86
# 4 73 10 41
# 2 1 3 3 4 2 3 14 3 11 1 2
# 1 7
#
# For each test case, print out a compressed sequence of numbers separated by a
# single space, one per line.
#
# Constraints:
#
#    T is in a range from 20 to 50.
#    N is in a range from 0 to 99.
#    L is in a range from 1 to 400.
